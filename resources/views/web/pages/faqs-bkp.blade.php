                     <p>We have a range of Membership options that are sure to fit in with your needs.
                     </p>
                     <p>Depending on the Viewer's display preference, the Search Page will present in either a

                     format the Viewers choose to view the Escort Home Page. Each Membership Type
                     reshuffles every 2 hours enabling all Advertisers to appear first from time to time within
                     their respective Membership Type on the Escort Home Page</p>

                     adding your Profile to their Legbox. That will entitle them to receive notifications from
                     you as well as having communication capability with you should you have those

                     <p><b>Q: What do I have to do to create a Profile?</b></p>
                     <p>There are two steps to creating your Profile. First you set up your Account, including
                     your Additional Information, which is referred to as My Account, and then from within
                     your Dashboard you create Profiles to advertise. You can create many profiles, for
                     example, a Profile for each city you visit or two Profiles within a Location. Like
                     ‘Perth01’ and ‘Perth02’. The difference may only be your Profile Name and the
                     published Media.</p>
                     <p>Although there may only be subtle differences between Profiles, you have the
                     convenience of activating the right Profile already configured for the city you are
                     visiting without having to edit the one Profile every time you travel to another Location. 
                     You have a 'Default Profile' in your Archives Folder which you use to create new
                     Profiles for Locations, or even more then one Profile for a Location.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can create a Profile at any time after registering on the <a class="c-red" href="{{ url('register')}}">registration page</a>. It is a
                     very quick and easy process to follow. You can create a Profile in less than 5 minutes. 
                     You can also request our assistance or better still, request the services of an <a class="c-red" href="{{ url('agent-register')}}">Agent</a>
                     who can help you create your Profile/s and manage your Account generally, along with
                     many other services.</p>
                     <p><b>Q: How many images and video can I have in my Profile?</b></p>
                     <p>You can have a maximum of seven photo images, including the Thumbnail,
                     irrespective of your Membership Type with your Thumbnail acting as the default image
                     displayed on the Escort Home Page (except for Free Membership). Platinum and
                     Gold Members can also upload a maximum of three videos as well as their photos
                     being displayed in a larger format than other Membership Types on the Escort Home
                     Page in both List View and Grid View.
                     </p>
                     <p>Your can retain many photos and video in your Archive Folder, but you are limited to
                     the number of photos and video permitted in a Profile.</p>
                     <p><b>Q: How long does it take for my advertisement to go online?</b></p>  
                     <p>When you create a Profile and pay the Fee, the Profile is published immediately. If
                        you have included Verified Photos in the Profile, our support team, whilst they will
                        have a report advising us you have posted the Profile, will not necessarily review the
                        Profile.
                        </p> 
                                             <p>If the Profile you have posted does not contain Verified Photos, then our support team
                        will review the Profile to check the Media is compliant with the Classification Laws. 
                        The review of your Profile will be completed within 24 hours. If the Profile is deemed
                        to be non-compliant, then the Profile will be suspended and you will be notified by
                        email. You will have the option to edit the Profile which will then be immediately
                        posted and the support team will again review the Profile, if any of the Media is not
                        verified.</p> 
                                             <p>All Media which is verified will be displayed with an E4U Verification Icon (see Website
                        Icons).</p> 
                                             <p>During the review of your Profile, if the Profile is suspended for more than one day,
                        and the Fee paid includes the supended period, then the Fee will be credited back to
                        you.</p> 

                        <p><b>Q:How can I maximise my presence?</b></p> 
                        <p>Most Escorts usually advertise on a number of websites. When advertising on another
                        website, include your website address to Escorts4U. For example,
                        www.escorts4u.com.au/123456 (your Profile ID Number). Over time your clients,

                        <p><b>Q:Do I need to have professional photography?</b></p> 

                        <p>We recommend that your Media is professional in quality. But it is entirely up to you.
                        Self images are fine but you should always bear in mind that the more professional the
                        photos, the better your chances of attracting clients. Overall though, your photos do
                        not need to be taken by a professional photographer, but must have a good quality
                        finish. Remembering, the higher quality images you provide, the more striking
                        presentation we can make for you.</p>
                        <p>It is important that images have a certain mood, atmosphere and sensuality. This is
                        essential in order to capture the attention of your potential clients, and leave them
                        wanting to see more. Try not to have obscure or misleading photos. Any Media
                        where the face is not present or obscure may be rejected.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Q:Can you recommend any professional photographers?</b></p> 
                        <p>We do not provide any recommendations for professional photographers. You will
                           need to speak to your colleagues or use good old "Google".

                           <p><b>Q:Can I advertise with you if I am working for an Massage Centre?</b></p> 
                           <p>Absolutely. You can have your own Account and post Profiles whenever you want as
                           well as being included in the Massage Profile should the Massage Centre also
                           register. Just remember, by registering and creating your own Account, you are
                           considered to be an Escort for the purposes of posting a Profile.

                     Your Profile setup has a provision for you to insert your SWA number. You will not be

                     want to Tour?</b></p>
                     <p>Yes you absolutely can. In fact you can go further by creating a Profile for each city
                     you visit. Each Profile is kept in your Archive Folder. Simply turn off your Profile when
                     you are leaving a city and turn on your Archived Profile for the city your are next
                     visiting. Very convenient. This way you can have subtle differences between Profiles
                     and Locations. 
                     </p>
                     <p>You can go one step further and create a Tour, two or more Locations, by linking your
                     Profiles you have created and stored in your Archive Folder. Once you post your Tour
                     all you need to do is keep to the scheduled dates you have set in the Tour. Each

                     taken down at midnight preceding the day you leave, all done automatically. You don't
                     need to do anything. You can edit your Tour along the way if your schedule changes. 
                     The Website keeps track of any changes to your Tour along the way, such as where
                     you shorten a stay in a Location, you will be credited for the number of days you have

                     <p><b>Q: Why does the Website have a Home State and Location?</b>

                     </p>
                     <p>By designating the Advertiser with a Home State, the Website will function more
                     accurately when posting Profiles and Tours. For example, in Victoria you are required
                     to be registered under the <a class="c-red" href="#">Sex Work Act 1994</a> and display your SWA registration
                     number. When completing your Profile Information in the Dashboard, the Website will
                     know to make the SWA number mandatory to you.
                     Whereas, when you are on Tour, the Location is simply the State you are visiting.
                     Geolocation technology is deployed in the Website. When you register, the Website
                     will automatically know your Location and will then deem it your Home State, unless
                     you change it. Once you complete your registration, the Home State can not be
                     changed.</p>
                     <p><b>Q:What exactly is SMS 2FA authentication?</b></p>
                     <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an additional layer of end-user Account protection
                     beyond a password. It significantly decreases the risk of Account takeovers where a
                     hacker accesses banking, shopping, social media or other online accounts by
                     combining the password (something you know) with a second factor, like a one-time
                     passcode or push notification sent to your mobile phone (something you have).
                     </p>
                     <p><b>Q: Is SMS 2FA the same thing as two-step verification?</b></p>
                     <p>Yes. Websites refer to this security feature in several different ways: two-factor
                     authentication (or 2FA), two-step verification (or 2-Step), multi-factor authentication
                     and two-step authentication.</p>
                     <p><b>Q: How does SMS 2FA work?</b></p>
                     <p>This form of authentication is actually quite simple. After signing in, the User receives
                     a text message with an SMS authentication code. All they need to do is enter that
                     code into the field provided on the Website to gain access. You have probably already
                     experienced this process yourself when logging into websites like Amazon, Facebook,
                     Google, Twitter, and other services like banking.</p>
                     <p>As a possession-based factor, SMS 2FA verifies a User’s identity based on something
                     they own, like their mobile phone. This adds an extra layer of security to a login. In
                     theory, bad actors would have to steal a User’s password and their mobile phone in
                     order to gain unauthorised access to your Account.</p>
                     <p><b>Q: What if I lose my mobile phone?</b></p>
                     <p>If your mobile phone is lost or stolen you should immediately contact your mobile
                     phone provider to lock access to the device. Additionally, to prevent unwanted access
                     to your personal phone data and apps in the case where it is lost or stolen, it is always
                     a best practice to utilise the lock feature in your phone's settings. You should set your
                     mobile phone to lock and require a password for use of the device when you are not
                     actively using it. </p>
                     <p>As a general guide on passwords, use different passwords across your accounts; use
                     a combination of special characters, numbers and both upper and lowercase letters;
                     avoid using passwords that include information that can be easily discovered online
                     like maiden names, high school mascots and phone numbers; do not create
                     passwords that are so complicated that they need to be written down or that require a
                     password reset on every login.</p>

                                                <p>When raising a query with us, we can only trace and allocate a payment to your Profile
                        if it has the correct Payment Reference. It is very important that your payment query
                        has the correct Payment Reference, which is the confirmation reference number we
                        provide you in your email notification once your published Profile Fee has been made. 
                        It is like a receipt.</p> 
                        <p>When you view a published Profile in your Archive Folder, the Profile will have the
                        number reference attached to it for your convenience. A current published Profile is
                        retained in the ‘Current Publications’ sub-folder in your Archive Folder. All historical
                        publications are retained in your ‘History’ sub-folder.</p>

                                       <p><b>Q: What Account information is mandatory for a Viewer and what is not?</b></p>
                                       <p>When you register to be come a Member, there is some mandatory information we
                                       request from you, such as your:
                                       </p>
                                       <ul>
                                          <li>mobile number; and</li>
                                          <li>Home State (where you are domiciled).
                                       </li>
                                       </ul>
                                       <p>You do not have to provide your name but it is optional and should you choose to have
                                       a name, the name you choose can be anonymous in nature. </p>
                                       <p><b>Q: To what extent is Geolocation applied in the Website?</b>
                                       </p>
                                       <p>Geolocation by proxy IP is by Country-Region-City. The Website does not undertake
                                       any geolocation search beyond the City you reside in. If you do not live in a capital
                                       city, then the Website will by default attach you to the capital city in the region
                                       Location.</p>
                                       <p><b>Q: Once I am online, can I update my Profile(s) by myself?</b>

                                       </p>
                                       <p>Absolutely, you can. Managing your Profiles has never been easier. All Advertisers
                                       have their own username and password, and have the ability to login and update their
                                       Account, Profile Information and Profiles any time of the day. All changes to Profile
                                       content and settings will be visible online immediately.
                                       We even make it much easier for you by making available an Agent to help you with
                                       your Account, Profile Information, Profiles and Tours. Once you have registered, you
                                       simply <a class="c-red" href="#">request the help of an Agent</a> and they will help you with all your queries and
                                       management of your Account.</p>
                                       <p><b>Q: Can I update my Media?</b></p>
                                       <p>You certainly can. You will have direct access to your image gallery and videos
                                       retained in your Archive Folder. Simply log on and upload or delete Media retained in
                                       your Archive Folder (those which are displayed in any of your Profiles) any time of the
                                       day. You can move Media around and nominate which photo image is your
                                       Thumbnail or Banner Image.</p>
                                       <p>If required, we will format your Media for you, to create a striking presentation. All
                                       changes to images will be online within a 24 hour period of new images having been
                                       uploaded (often within a few hours).
                                       </p>
                                       <p>Once you have all of your images and video uploaded in your Archive Folder, you will
                                       have three groups of Media:</p>
                                       <ul>
                                          <li>Thumbnail (default image for your series of Profile photos - up to 7)</li>

                                       a play tag)</li>
                                       <p style="border: none;">If you have requested Escorts4U to verify your Media, we will attach an Escorts4U

                                       <p>You can delete Media from your Archive Folder by simply selecting the cross on the
                                          image and it is deleted. You can organise your images into groups (folders within your

                                 <p>You can select your Thumbnail or Banner Image (the preview image that appears
                  across the top of your Profile) by logging on, selecting your preferred image and
                  dragging it to the Profile basket. You can have a different Thumbnail or Banner Image
                  for each Profile you create.</p>
                  <p>The Thumbnail you select for any Profile will be the photo image which appears on the
                  Search Page where your Profile is listed.</p>         
                                 <p><b>Q: Can I see how much traffic I am generating for my Profile?</b></p>
                                 <p>You certainly can. From the moment you begin to advertise with us you will be able to
                  access your Dashboard and view all of your analytics from within your Dashboard. 
                  The Profile statistics are broken down into numerous information groups to assist you
                  when analysing your successes.</p>         
                                 <p><b>Q; How does the Tour feature work?</b>

                                 <p>As soon as you create your Tour from your selected Profiles, it will be posted
                  according to your start date. One day prior to your first Tour destination you will appear
                  on the Escort Home Page for that Location, according to the Membership Type you
                  have chosen when you created the Tour. That is, if you selected Platinum you will
                  appear in the top group on the Escort Home Page.</p>
                  <p>This will enable you to have maximum exposure before your Tour commences, and
                  give you the chance to take pre bookings in advance. You can also send out a V-Alert
                  to those Viewers who have added you to their Legbox and enabled the V-Alert feature
                  to receive V-Alert notifications. Where you select this option in the Tour creator, a
                  V-Alert will be automatically forwarded to Viewers one day before each leg of the Tour. 
                  This is a free service.</p>
               <p></p> 
               <p><b>Q: Do I need to enter information into my Tour?</b></p>
               <p>Your Tour will automatically use the same information and Media that is set up in each
                  of your selected Profiles you have created for your different Locations. Like for
                  example, your Sydney and Melbourne Profiles.</p><p>
                  If you would like to display different information in your Tour, such as Rates, About Me
                  or Availability, you can login and edit your Tour at any time or you can edit the
                  information while you create the Tour.</p>
                  <p>For Tours which include Victoria, in order for us to display your Profile in Victoria,
                  images will need to comply with Victorian legislation. You cannot show your bare
                  breasts, buttocks, anus or full frontal nudity of the genital region. You will also need to
                  supply us with your SWA number, to comply with the Victorian legislation.
                  Escort advertising laws in Australia differ from state to state. Before you embark on a
                  Tour, it is your responsibility to become familiar with the Local Laws and ensure you
                  are compliant (see Local Laws above).</p><p>
                  While on Tour, if you upgrade your Membership Type you will not lose any remaining
                  days you have paid for. They will be applied automatically if you do not continue at
                  the higher Membership Type.</p>

                  </p>
                                 <p>An Agent is a person or entity that has been appointed by Escorts4U in a designated
                  Location, like for example the “Victorian Agent”. The role of the Agent is to assist
                  Advertisers in the management of their Account, Media, Profiles, Tours, Concierge
                  Services and Account information.</p>
                  <p>You can appoint an Agent at any time by either:

                  <ul>
                     <li>Nominating the Agent as a part of the registration process; or by</li>

                  </ul>    
                  <p>When you appoint an Agent, you enter into an arrangement with the Agent directly for
                  the Agent to provide the Agent Services. The Agent will have full access to your
