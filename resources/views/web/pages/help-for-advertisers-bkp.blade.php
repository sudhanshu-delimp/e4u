                   <p>There are several types of Membership available:</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>Independent Escorts</li>
                      <li>Massage Centres</li>
                      <li>Viewers (it is free); and</li>
                      <li>Agent, management services for Escorts and Massage Centres</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><b>Q: What is the effect on me according to the Membership type I select?</b></p>
                   <p>We have a range of Membership options that are sure to fit in with your needs.</p>
                   <p>Depending on the Viewer's display preference, the Search Page will present in either a
"List View" or "Grid View" format. Viewers can then select to view your Profile. You will
always rank within your Membership Type in all search results irrespective of which
format the Viewers choose to view the Escort Home Page. Each Membership Type
reshuffles every 2 hours enabling all Advertisers to appear first from time to time within
their respective Membership Type on the Escort Home Page.</p>
<p>A viewer can ‘flag’ your Profile and then view the list of Profiles from within the Escort
Home Page that they have selected. A registered Viewer can go one step further by
adding your Profile to their Legbox. That will entitle them to receive notifications from
you as well as having communication capability with you should you have those
features enabled.</p>
<p>Each Membership Type enjoys certain benefits according to that Membership Type. 
The following table summarises the distinctions between each Membership Type
according to the format:</p>

<p>Yes, there are no fees to pay for Membership. You only pay for the Services you use. 
And your first two weeks advertising with us are free!</p>
<p>Create and refine your Profile over the two weeks and then decide if you want to
continue using us. There are no restrictions placed on how your Profile is published
except that you will not feature at the top of the Escort Home Page under the
Membership Type - Free.</p>
<p>All of our paying Advertisers are prioritised to the front of the Escort Home Page
according to the Membership Type they choose when publishing their Profile. You can
elect to become a paying Advertiser at any time. If you never advertise with us, your
Account will always remain and there are no Fees.
</p>
<p>Registered Viewers will have full access to your Profile including unrestricted
communication rights should you have the texting and email features enabled.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are there any great features available to me?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We have a number of great features to enhance your Profile and relationship
building with Viewers. You can:

when you are visiting their Location</li>

$200.00 in advertising an Escort spends with us, we will reward you with 1 day of free
advertising (Platinum and Gold level). And for a Massage Centre, every $500.00 you
spend with us we will reward you with 1 day of free advertising. You can use your
rewards any time you like, or accumulate your rewards and use them all at once, it is
entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Discounts to advertising Fees also apply once you spend over a certain amount. The
discounts are very generous.
</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I get help to manage my Account?</b></p>

                  <p class="pt-4"><b>Q: How do I pay for advertising?</b></p>
                  <p>Payment, by Card, is requested when you post a Profile or Tour or take up any of the
Concierge Services. If you renew your Profile, your Card will be debited automatically.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: Does Escorts4U retain my Card details?</b></p>
                  <p>Our secure, third-party payments provider retains your details. Escorts4U does not
directly retain your Card details.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: Can I transfer Credits I have earnt from my Loyalty program?</b>
</p>
                  <p>Yes, when you create a Profile or Tour, any Credits you have will be displayed and you
will have the option to utilise them.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: What is the easiest way to pay?</b>
</p>
                  <p>There are effectively three payment options, all with your Card, namely:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Pay as you go. If you post a Profile for 3 days, you can pay for 3 days.</li>
                     <li>Pay in advance. You can pay a lump sum into your Account and then draw down
on those funds as you post and renew your Profiles or Tours.
</li>
                     <li>Pay and renew. You pay for the number of days you have selected for your Profile,
and elect to automatically renew your Profile each nominated period thereafter (like
every 5 days) and for the nominated occurrences (like for 3 renewals).</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  <p>All transactions are completed using SMS 2FA and are confirmed by email notification
to you. You can also view all of your purchase history from your Dashboard.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: How do you set prices?</b></p>
                  <p>Our main objective is to provide value-for-money in an effective way. Our pricing is
defined on a daily per Location basis with discounts applying for longer booking
periods (22 days or more). We only raise prices (and not often) when the number of
enquiries and Advertisers goes over a certain level. This is to maintain the number of
Platinum and Gold listings at a level where each paid advertisement will continue to
receive the number of enquiries the Member expects from us.</p>
                  <p>We introduced variable pricing (Membership Types) after talking to many Advertisers
who were asking how they could get more exposure and indicated they were willing to
pay more if they could stand out.
</p>
                  <p>You also have the option of appearing on the Home Page as the Pin Up for your
Home State or Location if you are touring. You can register to activate this feature
through your Dashboard. Your Profile is posted as the Pin Up for an exclusive seven
day period. This is a very popular feature and registration is required. You will be
notified when your turn becomes available and asked if you still wish to proceed with
the listing. If you confirm you wish to proceed, your Profile will appear in the Pin Up
position the following day. Your Card will be automatically debited.</p>

                  <p>Absolutely not. We have a strict policy that all images must belong to the Escort, and
be of themselves. This is mandatory and there is no negotiation on this policy.

</p>
                  <p><b>Q:  Is it a requirement to have my photos verified?</b></p>
                  <p>Image verification is not a requirement, it is optional. However, we highly recommend
you have your images verified by us so that you can better establish client trust. You
should remember that the biggest complaint from Viewers is fake Media and Profiles. 
If a report is made our support staff will investigate and if the Profile is found to have
fake Media then the Profile will be Suspended.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: How do I get my photos verified?</b>
</p>
                  <p>We have our own image verification process. Please <a href="email:privacy@escorts4u.com.au" class="termsandconditions_text_color text-decoration-none">email us</a> for more information.
</p>
                  <p>If you pass our image verification criteria, we will mark your Media with the prestigious
E4U Verification Icon, which essentially verifies your Media as being genuine.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: Will any images of me be blurred?</b></p>

                  <p>We offer a blurring service free of charge to Platinum Advertisers. The service is
available to Gold and Silver Members with the payment of a Fee. All Advertisers can
have up to a maximum of six photo images per month blurred.
</p>
<p>Facial blurring is always styled with a light blurring effect. The blurring service does
not include the removal of large tattoos or alterations to an Escort's appearance.</p>
<p>All images for blurring must be submitted at the same time and be verified.
</p>
                  <p><b>Q: What are the photograph image requirements to advertise?</b></p>
                  <p>We have a strict policy on what images you can publish. Your images must:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Be good quality and high resolution</li>
                     <li>Be your own (of yourself). Other people in the image is acceptable provided you
have their consent</li>
                     <li>Have no large or distracting watermarks (we will watermark your photos for you)
</li>
                     <li>Have no photographer's watermarks (they will be removed, or we will request new
images without the watermark)
</li>
                     <li>Be professional in quality. They do not need to be taken by a professional
photographer, but must have a good quality finish
</li>
                  
                  </ul>
                  <p>You can publish a montage photo image provided that each of the images contained
in the montage are compliant with our policy.
</p>
<p>We will not publish any images which:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Are low quality (too small, dark, grainy or blurry)</li>
   <li>We find on non escort websites, or any photo where we have doubt about the
ownership of the image</li>
   <li>Overly explicit, and most likely do not comply with the <a href="{{ url('law-enforcement')}}" class="termsandconditions_text_color text-decoration-none">Local Laws</a> or <a href="{{ url('law-enforcement')}}" class="termsandconditions_text_color text-decoration-none">Classification Laws</a></li>
   <li>Have borders or frames that have been added with a photo program (please upload
your original images without borders)</li>
   <li>Have watermarks that have been placed by the photographer to advertise their
business
</li>
   <li>Have watermarks of another advertising platform</li>
   <li>Have your contact details on them, such as email, telephone or website address.
(This information is set out in your Profile)
</li>
   <li>Contain magazine covers, publications or video/DVD covers</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: What are the video requirements for inclusion in my Profile?</b></p>
<p>We have a strict policy on the content of your video you can publish. Your video must:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Be no longer than 30 seconds</li>
   <li>Be in either mp4 or wav format. You can not provide a link to your video</li>
   <li>Not contain any sexually explicit content or language, like for example, intercourse</li>
   <li>Not contain any of your contact details, such as email, telephone or website
address. This information is set out in your Profile</li>

                   <p>If you provide a complete Profile with accurate information, you will increase the
number and quality of results you get from it. We have a very comprehensive Profile
creator which will help you create a great Profile for yourself. Much of the creator is
simply tick the box or select from a drop down menu. The Profile creator also preloads all of your Profile Information, which makes it very quick and easy to create a
Profile. Spend the time to complete your Profile Information, you will find the time is
well spent. Here are some good tips for you:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Put real photos up, preferably more than one. You can upload up to 6 photos plus
your Thumbnail. Make sure you have had them verified to save time when you post
your Profile</li>
   <li>Take time to provide a good description of yourself and the services you offer. You
can set your services in your Profile Information and Account settings</li>
   <li>List only the services you provide. The Profile creator has a comprehension
selection of services where you can easily select from your drop down list</li>
   <li>Make sure your phone number and email address, if you are enabling email, is
correct</li>
   <li>If you have a video to upload, make sure it is not too long and that the recording is
of good quality. You can have up to 3 videos per Profile
</li>
   <li>Include your social media links if you have any</li>
   
</ul>
<p>Please do not:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Post fake listings or fake photos, it will eventually come to our attention and the
Profile will be either suspended or removed
</li>
   <li>Use ALL CAPS, it looks CHEAP. Clients do not like you yelling at them</li>
   <li>Use foul or unacceptable language
</li>
   <li>Attempt to deceive Viewers. You will get caught out and that may have an effect on
your reputation if a review is posted</li>
   <li>Enable Service Tags for services that you do not provide. Only select Service Tags
for services that you actually provide. Viewers might form a negative view of you
and reflect that view in a Review</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: Can I have more than one Profile?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you absolutely can. If you create more than one Profile for a Location make sure
you use a different Profile Name for each Profile , perhaps use different Media and set
out a different summary about yourself. Our Profile creator is very detailed, you will be
very satisfied with how we present your Profile.
</p>
<p>You can archive your Profiles in the Archive Folder so that you do not have to edit or
recreate the one Profile across a number of Locations, including more than one in the
same Location. Just switch on and switch off the Profile for the Location you are in. It
is really easy to manage your Profiles and post them.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I make Profiles for different individuals?</b></p>
<p>Yes, as long as you have their permission for you to list them and they are real people.</p>
<p>If you are a Massage Centre, you only need to create one Profile as a Massage
Centre Profile allows you to post up to 8 Masseur Profiles (see <a href="#" class="termsandconditions_text_color text-decoration-none">Help for Massage Centres</a>).
</p>
<p><b>Q: How are Profiles ordered?</b></p>
<p>Profiles within each Membership Types are randomised every 2 hours and customised
to each individual Advertiser according to their Profile Information. The search bar in
the Website is very powerful and enables Viewers to search Advertisers by:</p>
<ul>
   <li>State / Capital City</li>
   <li>Gender</li>
   <li>Age</li>
   <li>Rate</li>
   <li>Service type, such as Massage, Incall or Outcall; and</li>
   <li>Verified Photos</li>
</ul>
<p>The search bar also has an advanced feature whereby Viewers can also search by
Service Tag for:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Fun stuff on the Viewer</li>
   <li>Kinky stuff on the Viewer</li>
   <li>Fun stuff on the Advertiser</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important that you set your Profile Information for Service Tags accurately so
that a Viewer can undertake a search with confidence.
</p>
<p>By completing your Profile creator and answering all the questions, you enhance your
chances of being found with the search bar. We do this to provide the best possible
experience for Advertisers and Viewers ensuring that all Advertisers in a single
Membership Type receive a similar amount of exposure to Viewers.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is fake Media OK?</b></p>
<p>If you post any fake Media, your Account will be suspended. If we determine that you
have other Accounts, they will also be suspended regardless of whether they are
genuine or not. There are no excuses and we will not enter into any discussion with
you. Posting fake Media is fraud and a breach of intellectual property rights of the
owner of the fake media. If you have paid for Profiles and you are Suspended the
Credits are not refundable.
</p>
<p>You will have an opportunity to edit the suspended Profile to remove the fake Media.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why are my photos marked as fake?</b></p>
<p>This is the most common complaint from other Advertisers and Viewers about Profiles
- fake Media. Further, fake Media is not fair and does not provide for a level playing
field for all the Advertisers. Your Media may be marked as fake because of a report
from an Advertiser or Viewer. You will receive a warning email from us giving you 48
hours to have your Media verified before your Profile is returned to active.
</p>
<p><b>Q: What is not OK?</b></p>
<p>If you are an Advertiser and do not follow the Policies, your Account, including any
future accounts, will be blocked.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable for:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Underage photos or photos of children to appear in any Profile
</li>
   <li>Trafficking, enslavement or anything similar to be promoted</li>
   <li>Abuse, violence or oppressive behaviour to be directed towards other Advertisers or
Viewers</li>
   <li> Online trolling or other defamation to be directed towards other Advertisers or
Viewers</li>

            Ugly Mugs Register

                   <p class="pt-4"><b>Q: What is the Ugly Mugs Register?</b></p>
                   <p>The National Ugly Mugs register (NUM) is a pioneering, national concept delivered by
Escorts4U through this Website. It is designed to provide greater protection for
Advertisers who are often targeted or find themselves the victim of a dangerous
individual, but are reluctant to report the incident to the police. These offenders are
often serial sexual predators or criminals who pose a risk to Escorts and to the public
as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does the register help me?</b></p>
<p>As a registered Advertiser, you will have access to NUM through your Dashboard. 
You simply complete an online report regarding your incident, and the NUM Report is
made available to other Escorts via their Dashboard. You remain anonymous.
</p>
<p><b>Q: Is NUM confidential?</b></p>
<p>Yes. NUM operates under a strict confidentiality policy which means we will not
disclose or share information outside the Escorts4U team without your permission.
Your information will be held electronically on a secure system. We follow strict
guidelines of confidentiality, and we can reassure you that we will always protect your
interests and respect to everything you say.</p>
<p>We follow the <a href="{{ url('law-enforcement')}}" class="termsandconditions_text_color text-decoration-none">Local Laws</a> and the principles set out in the Privacy Act and the <a href="#" class="termsandconditions_text_color text-decoration-none">Notifiable Data Breaches</a> scheme.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the NUM funded by the police?</b></p>
<p>No. Escorts4U has no connection with any of the police services throughout Australia.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I make a report?</b></p>
<p>Simply log on and go to your Dashboard. Select "Make a Report" to submit your
incident. The NUM report will be reviewed by our support team and then published to
other Escorts via the NUM register. Only Advertisers have access to the NUM
register.
</p>
<p><b>Q: What is a NUM Alert?</b></p>
<p>An Alert is simply a warning meant to alert Escorts to people or situations that may be
dangerous to them.</p>
<p>When we receive a NUM Report it will be moderated and risk assessed by our support
staff and sanitised to form an Alert. This will then be posted onto the NUM register,
which registered Advertisers can access from their Dashboard. We also email or text
to other Escorts, who have enabled the service, alerting them of dangerous
individuals.
</p>
<p><b>Q: What can I do in the NUM register?</b></p>
<p>When you register as an Advertiser you automatically gain access to the NUM
register. You can:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>View Alerts</li>
   <li>Make a report</li>
   <li>Do a number check</li>
   <li>Do an email check</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: Can I do a Number check?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Simply log on and follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Go to your dashboard.</li>
   <li>Click "Lookup"</li>
   <li>Type in the number you want to check in the search field</li>
   <li>Select "Submit"</li>
   <li>A message will appear letting you know if there has been a match or not (this
service is subject to the Privacy Act).</li>

</ul>
<p>As the number checker is new, there are not so many 'ugly numbers' in the database,
so if there is no match this is not to say that the number and person using the number
are safe to meet with.
</p>
<p>Every time an 'ugly number' is reported to NUM it will be immediately added to the
database.
</p>
<p><b>Q: What happens if I make a false report?</b></p>
<p>If we determine that you have mad a false report your Account will be cancelled.</p>

application on your behalf.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can Escorts4U help me with my Visa?</b></p>

placement services who can assist you by providing all the advice you need to sort out
your needs. Just logon and from your Dashboard, select Concierge Services - Visa. 
Complete the Visa request form and we will be in touch.
</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I open a Bank account by myself?</b></p>
<p>If you choose to open a Bank account within six weeks of your arrival you will only
need your passport as identification. If you wait more than six weeks after your arrival
to open an account you will need extra identification like a birth certificate, driver's
licence or credit card.</p>
<p>When opening your Bank account, make sure you are very clear about your address.
Ask to view your address details entered up by the Bank officer on the monitor to be
absolutely sure the address is correct. This will avoid any problems with the delivery
of your debit card. Bank officers are human and make mistakes.
</p>
<p><b>Q: My card has not arrived, what should I do?</b></p>
<p>If your card has not arrived within the time the Bank advised you it would take for the
card to arrive, go back to the Bank and re-order the card. Some Banks, as an interim
solution, will issue you an international debit card while you are there. You will need to
transfer funds into the international account the Bank creates for you. You can do that
via your Bank app.
</p>
<p>If you have to go down this path, don’t be intimidated by the Bank. Insist they issue
the international card. Most Banks issue the card from the branch.
</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I move money Internationally?</b></p>
<p>Most Banks in Australia have International Money Transfer services as a part of their
online banking service. Once you have opened your Bank account and registered to
access your online banking, simply go to the "International Transfers" page of the
Bank website and follow the instructions. There are terms and conditions attached to
the Bank which you have to comply with in relation to international money transfers</p>
