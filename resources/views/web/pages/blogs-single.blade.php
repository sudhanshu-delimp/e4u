                        <p>We often receive emails from new escorts entering the industry, or established escorts who will be working in Brisbane, the Gold Coast or other cities in Queensland for the first time, who are not familiar with the state legislation and the rules surrounding advertising in Queensland <b>(Local Laws).</b> In this blog, we will give you a little bit of information about the basic things that you need to be aware of, and links to important resources.</p>
                        <p>Queensland has very specific laws when it comes to sex work advertising. We will list some of these regulations below, but please be advised that this list is not exhaustive. It is the responsibility of each escort to be familiar with the <a href="#">Local Laws</a> in the state where you will be working.</p>
                        <h2>Qld Escorts cannot do any of the following:</h2>
                        <ul>
                           <li>cannot provide unprotected services (including oral)</li>
                           <li>cannot provide doubles with another escort</li>
                           <li>cannot use the word "massage" in your advertising</li>
                           <li>cannot list or describe your services in your advertising</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Escorts4U manages your profile settings and where it is appropriate, blocks the SERVICES section of your Profile in Queensland. However, it is important that you do not list services in the other sections of your profile (such as the About Me section), as that section will not be blocked in Queensland if it is non-complient.</p>
                        <h2>Qld Escort images cannot display the following:</h2>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The sexual organs or anus. You cannot display frontal or rear nudity of the genital
                              region
                           </li>
                           <li>A sexual act or simulated sexual act</li>
                           <li>A person under the age of 18 years</li>
                           <li>Pictures, drawings or references to alcohol (including images of wine bottles/glasses)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pera-note">NOTE: Escorts4U will censor images in Queensland Profiles if we see that they don't comply with the
                           Local Laws. However, it is the legal responsibility of Advertisers to check their images on their
                           Profile, and to ensure that they all comply with the Local Laws.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you are touring in Queensland, we will not display your selfie gallery or archive gallery
                           in your Profile in respect to Queensland.
                        </p>
