          <p>Escorts4U is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal
           information (<b>Personal Information</b>) of Users. Escorts4U maintains robust physical,
           electronic and procedural processes and safeguards to protect the Personal Information in
           our care, including personal information that an Agent may have access to. Escorts4U is
           bound by the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Act), as well as
           other laws, regulations and codes which apply to the nature of the services provided to
           you by Escorts4U. By using the Website, you are consenting to Escorts4U collecting,
           using and disclosing the Personal Information, including geolocation information, to lawful
           entities and for lawful purposes. The Personal Information is collected from you for the
         purposes of:</p>


         <ul>
           <li>Providing you with the Escorts4U services (Services);</li>
           <li>Identifying you, including your Home State;</li>
           <li>Managing and administering the Services; and</li>
           <li>Protecting against fraud (or suspected fraud) whether it is you or a member of the
           public.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The Personal Information you authorise Escorts4U to collect may include your name,
           address, date of birth, email address and such other information that is considered
           reasonably necessary for Escorts4U to meet its obligations under the Act. Where possible,
         Escorts4U will collect the Personal Information directly from you.</p>

         <p>In some circumstances, Escorts4U may need to collect the Personal Information from a
           third party. For example, Escorts4U may collect, from the provider of a payments platform
           where your transactions are stored (<b>Payments System</b>), information about the
           transactions you undertake with us. Escorts4U may also collect information from other
           participants in the Payments System and other financial institutions in order to resolve
           disputes or errors which are brought to our attention. If you do not provide some or all of
           the Personal Information requested, Escorts4U may be unable to provide you with the
         Services.</p>

         <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Right of withdrawal and information</h2>
         <p>Personal Information provided to Escorts4U may be requested for deletion at any time
           provided that the information is not required by Escorts4U or the Payments System for
           completing a financial transaction or is not lawfully required pursuant to any Local Laws.
         The Personal Information saved by Escorts4U will be provided on request at no cost.</p>

         <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Responsible authority</h2>

          <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Cookies</h2>
          <p>Escorts4U uses Cookies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In connection with the Users web browser, to optimise usage of the Website</li>
            <li>To remember the last activity of the User on the Website</li>
            <li>To maintain a realtime experience</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The use of the Cookies is applied in terms of saving the User's details (username,
            password and geolocation as applicable) and any settings the User may have applied.
            Cookies are used to identify the computer the User has accessed the Website. No
            personal data, except the Users IP-address for geolocation purposes, is saved. Escorts4U
            does not use any technology that may combine information obtained by Cookies with
          personal User data, so as to detect the identity or email address of the User.</p>

          <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Collection and processing of personal data</h2>
          <p>Our servers are located in Australia. If you choose to provide us with the Personal
            Information, you are consenting to the transfer and storage of that information to and on
            our servers in Australia.
          </p>
          <p>We collect and store the following Personal Information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Email address, physical location/contact information and financial information (where
            you post a Profile)</li>
            <li>Computer sign-in data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Website</li>
            <li>Other information including your IP address (geo-location) and standard web log
            information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note, data transmission over the Internet, such as the communication via e-mail
            between Advertisers and Escorts4U, can lead to security issues. Escorts4U can not
            guarantee complete protection of data against access by third parties where
          communication is undertaken by email.</p>
          <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Provision of personal data to other parties</h2>
          <p>Transfer or provision of personal data to a third party only occurs if Escorts4U:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is lawfully obligated to provide information to the requesting authority in relation to a
             Profile that an Advertiser has posted, or if the Advertiser has given the prior consent to
             the release of the personal data, which consent must be provided in writing to
           Escorts4U before any release of the said personal data</li>
           <li>Participants in the Payments System and other financial institutions for the purpose of
             resolving disputes, errors or other matters arising out of your use of your credit or debit
             card (Card) or third parties using the Card or information stored on or about the Card
           </li>
           <li>Is required by any third party service provider engaged by Escorts4U for the purpose
             of enabling Escorts4U to deliver the Services
           </li>

         </ul>
         <p>To facilitate transaction investigation and to assist with the identification of suspicious or
          fraudulent transactions, the Information and transaction details may be sent to countries
          other than Australia which participate in the Payments System. By using the Services, you
        agree that the Information and transaction details may be sent overseas.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, personal data will not be released, shared or sold to third parties for marketing
        or advertising purposes without the prior permission from the Advertiser or Viewer.</p>

        <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">The Use of Social Plugins and AdSense</h2>
        <p>The Website does not use any form of plugin which are commonly deployed by the social
          networks known as facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue,
          Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (<b>Facebook</b>), Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San
          Francisco, CA 94107, USA (<b>Twitter</b>), or Google AdSense, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
          Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (<b>Google</b>).</p>
          <p>When you visit a page on the Website, your browser will not be able to establish a direct
           connection to the Facebook, Twitter or Google servers, thus enabling Facebook, Twitter or
           Google to receive information about you having accessed any of the pages of the Website
           with your IP address. Whilst Escorts4U attempts to maintain the Users anonymity, it is not
         guaranteed.</p>
         <p>As a precaution, if you are a Facebook or Twitter member and do not want Facebook or
           Twitter to connect the data concerning your visit to the Website with your Facebook or
           Twitter member data, you should log off from Facebook or Twitter before entering the
         Website.</p>
         <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Google Analytics</h2>
         <p>The Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
           (<b>Google Analytics</b>). Google Analytics uses Cookies to help analyze the usage of the
           Website. The information generated by the Cookie about your use of the Website will be
           transmitted to and stored by Google Analytics on servers in the United States in most
           cases. Google will use this information on behalf of Escorts4U for the purpose of
           evaluating the Advertiser's use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity for
           Escorts4U and as well as providing other services relating to Website activity and internet
           usage. The IP address, that your browser conveys within the scope of Google Analytics,
         will not be associated with any other data held by Google Analytics.</p>
         <p class="text_decoration_for_a">You may refuse the use of Cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
           however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of
           this Website. You can also opt-out from being tracked by Google Analytics with effect for
           the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for your
           current web browser: <a href="#">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>

           <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Google +1</h2>
           <p>With the Google +1 interface (<b>Google +1</b>), you can publish information worldwide. This
            Website does not support Google +1, unless you have created a world-wide public Google
            profile, which must contain at least the chosen name for the Google +1 profile (<b>Google
            Profile</b>). Your Google Profile is used in all Google services. In some instances, your
            Google Profile can also be substituted for a different name that you used when sharing
            content with your Google account. The identity of your Google Profile may be shown to
            users who know your e-mail address, or have any other identifying information from you.
            Further to the preceding, the information you provide will be used in accordance with the
            applicable Google privacy policies. Google may release aggregated statistics about Users
            Google +1 activities or provide those findings to Google partners (Escorts4U utilises the
          services of digital media providers), such as publishers, advertisers or connected sites.</p>

          <h2 class="primery_color normal_heading">Third party/External websites</h2>
          <p>It is your responsibility to make yourself aware that other websites and other internet users
            may collect information, such as your e-mail address, that is published on the Website.
            This is due to the natural interconnectedness of the internet. Our data protection policies
            only apply to this Website and do not apply to external websites nor do they apply to the
          external activities of Users and the consequences arising from their internet activities.</p>
          <p>Escorts4U offers Users the possibility to interact with each other and to post a Profile
            under a cipher as an added security measure. This considerably hinders third parties from
            collecting Users personal data. Escorts4U also uses JavaScript to encode your email
            address (where submitted as a contact email pursuant to any registration on the Website)
            to prevent the scanning of the Users email address through external software. However,
            email addresses that are published openly in a Profile are not covered by this security
          feature.</p>
