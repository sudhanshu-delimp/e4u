                            understanding of the Escorts4U business model. Simply request the details and then
                            choose an accountant that is nearest to you. When you contact the accounting
                            practice, mention you are wanting to make an appointment to discuss becoming an
                            Agent for Escorts4U.

                            No. Your appointment is a non-exclusive appointment within a Location. It is not our

                            is adequate to service all of the Advertisers needs in any Location.
