                         choose an accountant that is nearest to you. When you contact the accounting
                         practice, mention you are wanting to make an appointment to discuss becoming an

                         look after you interests under the Agent Agreement. The Agent Agreement is very
                         comprehensive and sets out in a very clear manner what is expected of you as an Agent.

                         under the Agent Agreement, we do work closely with you and encourage you to be a

                     other Agents then you can do so. We do not permit Agents from one Location to
