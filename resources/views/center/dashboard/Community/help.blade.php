                                    <p>Payment, by credit card, is requested when you post a Profile. If you renew the Profile, your credit card will be debited automatically.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, we do. Our third party payments provider retains your details. Escorts4U does not directly retain your credit card details.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-2"><b>Q: Can I transfer credits I have earnt from my Loyalty program?</b></p>
                                    <p>Yes, whenyou create a Profile, any credits you have will be displayed and you will have the option to utilise them.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-2"><b>Q: What is the easiest way to pay?</b></p>
                                    <p>You can pay for your advertising by 2 methods, namely:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>Pay as you go. Simply create your Profile/s, select the number of days for advertising and payment is calculated accordingly; or</li>
                                       <li>Pay a sum as a credit towards future advertising. When you upload a Profile and set the number of days your charges are automaticly calculated and deducted from your credit total.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>All transactions are confirmed by email notifcation to you. You can also view all of your purchase history from your Dashboard.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-2"><b>Q: How do you set prices?</b></p>
                                    <p>Our main objective is to provide value-for-money in an effective way. Our pricing is defined on a daily per city basis with discounts for booking longer periods. We only raise prices (and not often) when the number of enquiries and Advertisers goes over a certain level. This is to maintain the number of Platinum and Gold listings at a level where each paid listing will continue to receive the number of enquiries they expect from us.</p>
                                    <p>We introduced variable pricing after talking to many Advertisers who were asking how they could get more exposure and indicated they were willing to pay more if they could stand out.</p>
