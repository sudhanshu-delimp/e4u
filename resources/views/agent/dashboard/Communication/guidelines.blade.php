                                            </ul>

                                            <h2>Importance of context</h2>
                                            <p>Context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified
                                                by the story-line
                                                or themes (the intensity of the photograph or video and the perception by
                                                the community).
                                                In particular, the way in which important social issues are dealt with may
                                                require a mature
                                                or adult perspective. This means that material that falls into a particular
                                                classification
                                                category in one context may fall outside it in another. In the case of this
                                                website and the
                                                photos and video that Advertisers submit, the distiction between R 18+ and X
                                                18+.

                                            <h2>Assessing impact</h2>
                                            <p>Assessing the impact of material requires considering not only the treatment
                                                of individual
                                                classifiable elements but also their cumulative effect. It also requires
                                                considering the purpose
                                                and tone of a sequence.</p>
