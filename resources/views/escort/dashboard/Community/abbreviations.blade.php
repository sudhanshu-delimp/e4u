                              <p>There are many abbreviations used by us and Advertisers throughout this Website. The
                                 escort industry in particular is renowned for having its own language as well as for
                                 describing certain activities on certain occasions. Much of the language, or lingo as it is
                                 often referred to as, is understood only by experienced clients of and the escorts
                                 themselves. 
                              </p>
                              <p>Many newcomers to the escort industry often find the use of the lingo daunting, and
                                 become frustrated trying to get their head around it. This can often lead to a
                                 misunderstanding between the client and the escort which is not a preferred outcome for
                                 either party.
                              </p>
                              <p>Similarly, it is important to understand what a Massage Centre’s service offering is so that
                                 there are no misunderstandings between the client and the Masseur.
                              </p>
                              <p>It is important for clients of escort and massage services to have a full understanding of
                                 what is being offered. A prospective client needs to know in advance:
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>What the boundaries for an Escort and Massage Centre are</li>
                                 <li>If the Escort or Masseur they are looking at in the Profile can fulfill the fantasies or
                                    services they are looking for; and
                                 </li>
                                 <li>The Escort can provide the services that they are seeking</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>So communication of the services on offer and the understanding of them are important to
                                 having a memorable and pleasant experience. To help you come to an informed decision,
                                 along with these abbreviations, Profiles are designed so as to ensure as much of the
                                 information an Escort or Massage Centre is advertising, is accurate. In addition to the
                                 industry lingo so widely used, which we have incorporated into the Profiles, we have also
                                 set out abbreviations and icons used by us in this Website to also assist you.
